# Earth_Leakage_Monitor
 Repo of Hardware and Software Built for Substations 
 Instrument will measure and display leakage current in the dc-db box at the power station
 Earth Leakage Monitoring is a critical task since any leakage exceeding 5mAmps will result in 
 control systems and transformers exploding
 The Instrument requirement were given by substation battery supplier in Tirupati India
 
 
 ELM specifications:
 
 Monitoring Ranges: 0 to 1m Amps, 5m Amps, 10m Amps, 20m Amps, 50m Amps
 
 Detection Resolution: 0.1m Apms
 
 Displays measured Leakage Current
 
 Zero adjust when no Error Button
 
 Range change Button
 
 Reset Button
 
 Relay Connection of NO, COM, and NC; used to trip other instruments or indicators or
 alarms in case of excess leakage current
 
 Caution: Calibrates to zero when Reset
